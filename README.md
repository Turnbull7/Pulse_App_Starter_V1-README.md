# Pulse — Sponsor-Ready Starter (Q4 2025 Target)

This repository is a **production-minded starter** for the Pulse™ app. It includes:
- **Mobile app (Expo/React Native + TypeScript)** for iOS/Android.
- **Backend API (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)** with auth, consent, events, and sponsor APIs.
- **Analytics service (Python)** to ingest events and generate trend signals for brands.
- **Data model** for users, sessions, events, segments, sponsors, and campaigns.
- **Privacy-by-design**: opt-in consent, data minimization, and deletion endpoints.

> Goal: Hand this to AI coders/engineers to complete feature build and ship MVP by late Q4 2025.
